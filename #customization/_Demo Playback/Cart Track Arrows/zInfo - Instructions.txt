The cart track might look too big/small depending on the payload mode.

Instructions
============
Simply run any of the AutoHotkey (.ahk) scripts to replace the default skin with a different one.
Or you could manually copy and paste the skin into the "../BingSoyHUD/materials/hud" directory

How to load/update the material
===============================
You need to reload the cart track material after replacing it (requires sv_cheats 1).
Disconnect from the current game if you're in a casual or community server then copy & execute the following line in the console (or use the "Reload Cart Arrow" button on the menu):
