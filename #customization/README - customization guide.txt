HUD customizations
==================
Please install AutoHotkey v2 for easy customization: the scripts will help copy & paste the customization overrides for you:
https://www.autohotkey.com/

➤ Customizations will require either a hud reload, material reload or game restart:
- Script overrides usually need hud reload with (or use the button in main menu):
hud_reloadscheme
- Materials can be reloaded with:
mat_reloadmaterial [MATERIAL NAME]
or to reload all materials (but slower):
mat_reloadallmaterials
- Menu customizations usually will need a game restart
- On top of reloading hud scheme, hudmatchstatus customizations may require changing teams, server reconnect or game reload
➤ Read the information & instructions of each folder.
➤ Don't rename or move any folders here unless you know what you're doing.
➤ Leave the "sourcedir"/"sourcedirmulti" folders alone! Either copy from them or let the autohotkey scripts copy for you.
